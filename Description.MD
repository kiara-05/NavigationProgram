**Title**: FAMU Campus Map Navigator

**Description**: This project will create a simple map navigation tool for FAMU's campus using C++. The program will allow users to input their current location and destination on campus, and it will provide walking directions to help them navigate between buildings. This will involve handling different data types to store building names and distances, file input/output for storing map data, and conditional statements to implement the logic behind route selection.

**Requirements**:

**User Input**:  
- Implement a user-friendly system that allows users to input their current building and destination building.
- Store building names and coordinates using appropriate data types (e.g., `string`, `int`, or `double`).

**Data Storage**:  
- Use a file to store map data, such as building locations and distances between them.
- Utilize file input/output operations (`ifstream` and `ofstream`) to read and update the stored map data.

**Route Calculation**:  
- Use if/else statements to select the best walking route between buildings based on user input.
- Implement logic to calculate walking distances between buildings.

**Summary Report**:  
- Display the walking directions step-by-step, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the route.
- Provide the total estimated walking time and distance.

**User Interaction**:  
- Implement a user menu that allows users to input their current location and destination, view the walking route, and exit the program.

**Error Handling**:  
- Include if/else statements to handle errors like invalid building names or routes that donâ€™t exist.
